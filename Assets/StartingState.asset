  storyText: 'When you arrive at the king''s room, you see his son and a bunch of
    guards staring at a dead body. The king has died! An unusual death... Poison?
    Stabbing? No one knows.


    You briefly speak with the king''s guard, and ask
    him if he has seen anything, he denies.

    The king''s son is in shock. He
    can barely speak.


    You exit the room, and see a piece of cloth lying on
    the floor...


    1) Pick up.

    2) Walk away.'
